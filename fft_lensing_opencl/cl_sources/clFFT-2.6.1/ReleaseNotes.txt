clFFT Contents
--------------
The clFFT library is an open source OpenCL library
implementation of discrete Fast Fourier Transforms. It:

* Provides a fast and accurate platform for calculating
  discrete FFTs
* Supports 1D, 2D, and 3D transforms with a batch size
  that can be greater than 1
* Supports planar (real and complex components in
  separate arrays) and interleaved (real and complex
  components as a pair contiguous in memory) formats
* Supports dimension lengths that can be any mix of
  powers of 2, 3, and 5
* Supports single and double precision floating-point
  formats
* Supports in-place or out-of-place transforms


clFFT - Release Notes - version 2.6.0
--------------------------------------

New features of this release:

* Significant uplift of 1D real forward transform
  performance for power-of-2 sizes
* Significant uplift of large 2D/3D real transform
  performance for power-of-2 sizes

Known issues:

* Size limit on 1D real transforms remain at 2^24
  for single precision and 2^22 for double
  precision

Driver notes:

* This library version has been tested with Catalyst
  Pro driver version 14.301 on Firepro W9100.


clFFT - Release Notes - version 2.4.0
--------------------------------------

New features of this release:

* Significant uplift of 1D complex transform performance
* 1D large size limit relaxation for complex transforms
* 2D/3D size limit relaxation on real and complex transforms
* Binary caching feature
* Several minor fixes and improvements
